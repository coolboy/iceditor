Features:

We have implemented four optimizations:
  1. push down the project and select node down to the table
  2. combine the relevant select conditions and product into a join operation
  3. choose the right join algorithm, order and access method to access the table
  4. calculate the cost for each node
 
Data Structures:

We implemented baniry tree, and a set of operations on it.
