1.? Break up selections (with conjunctive conditions) into
a cascade of selection operators!
2.? Push selection operators as far down in the tree as 
possible!
3.? Convert Cartesian products into joins!
4.? Rearrange leaf nodes to:!
? Execute ?rst the most restrictive select operators!
¨C? What is restrictive? (Fewest tuples or Smallest size) !
? Make sure we don?t have Cartesian products!
5.? Move projections as far down as possible!
6.? Identify subtrees that represent groups of operations
which can be executed by single algorithm!
